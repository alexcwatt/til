# Full Page Screenshot

Chrome DevTools has a built-in way to capture a full-page screenshot (including content below the fold) without any extensions.

1. Open DevTools (`Cmd+Option+I` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux).
2. Open the Command Menu (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. Type "screenshot" and select **Capture full size screenshot**.

This saves a PNG of the entire page, not just the visible viewport.

There are also options for **Capture screenshot** (visible viewport only), **Capture node screenshot** (a specific selected element), and **Capture area screenshot** (a custom selection).
