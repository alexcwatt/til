# Worktrees

Starting today, I am using worktrees. They are surprisingly easy to use. Since I no longer have access to cloud development environments at work, I have been wanting a way to conveniently have multiple copies of the same repository in different states - and wasn't sure I wanted to have multiple clones.

The top reasons I want more than one environment with the same project:

1. Reviewing peer code without needing to completely stop what I am doing
2. Having multiple projects going at once (not too many)

(I now have more reasons to do the latter because I am trying to embrace agentic workflows where I task an agent with doing something that might take a while.)

Let's see how it pans out! So far, so good - I just have to pay more attention to which folder my IDE has open, now that I have multiple copies of the same project.
